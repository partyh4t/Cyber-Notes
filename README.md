# What This Is

I've decided to start transferring certain notes of mine into this repository in hopes that it may help anyone who comes across it.

Here, you'll be able to find various resources ranging from:
- Walkthroughs/write-ups on HTB & THM machines.
- Helpful references that talk about different tools, what they're good for, and how to use them.
- Useful scripts I've gathered throughout the years, mainly for very specific use cases.
