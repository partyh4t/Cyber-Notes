# What This Is

I've decided to start transferring certain notes of mine into this repository in hopes that it may help anyone who comes across it. I'm also slightly refining them as I feel the need to improve my note-taking skills and ability to articulate and convey information clearly, _which is a crucial skill when it comes to Pen-testing and Vulnerability Assessments._

Here, you'll be able to find various resources ranging from:
- walkthroughs/write-ups on HTB & THM machines.
- helpful references that talk about different tools, what they're good for, and how to use them.
- useful scripts I've gathered throughout the years, mainly for very specific use cases.

### Note
Lastly, I want to note that I am by no means anywhere near as qualified as many other people in this field, so take this all with a grain of salt. This is just my perspective as someone who's never really had any real experience in the IT/Cybersec field. Feel free to drop some wisdom or correct me if anything is inaccurately explained.
